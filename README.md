  ## Description
  Makes readmes
~ This readme generator uses inquirer and node to make it possible. We used both heavily to make the the application. It was difficult for me to make get the data to actually print onto the readme.md file, I kept getting undefined values for my data but found that I had some typos and that is why it was not printing.

  ## Screenshots

  Screenshot above is the the terminal after running index.js, it will ask all the questions I have listed and then it will print that data on the generateMarkdown.js file, after that file runs it will create the readme.md file to view all the data the user provided in designated parts of the readme.
